# CookBook - a simple fullstack application and recipe store

This is the CookBook repo, where the files for installing the app are found. This app was made for the Web Dev Project course and developed using React, Javascript, HTML, CSS3. Technologies used: docker, nodejs.

The frontend is made using React and Javascript, and the backend is running nodejs with ExpressJS used for building the API.

Further updates are planned.

# Requirements

Docker compose

# How to install and use

Just clone the repo and in the root of the repo, use this command:

docker compose up -d

This launches the app and after a short time, you can visit the home page at localhost:80. Make sure no other process is running on port 80 or 8080, otherwise the app won't build.

After a successful build, feel free to add any recipes and view/edit/delete them!
